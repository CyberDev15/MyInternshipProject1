Project 1: 
Network Vulnerability Assessment: 
Objective: To evaluate interns' ability to identify and mitigate 
network vulnerabilities. Description: Network Assessment: 
Provide interns with a simulated network environment. Ask 
them to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment 
using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS. 
Vulnerability Identification: Have interns identify at least five 
critical vulnerabilities in the network. They should provide 
detailed reports on each vulnerability, including its severity, 
potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.  
Mitigation Plan: Instruct interns to create a mitigation plan for 
the identified vulnerabilities. This plan should include step-by
step instructions for remediation, estimated timelines, and any 
required resources or changes to network configurations.  
Presentation: Ask interns to prepare a brief presentation (10-15 
minutes) summarizing their findings, vulnerabilities identified, 
and the mitigation plan. They should also be prepared to answer 
questions from a panel of experts.  
Documentation: Interns should submit a comprehensive report 
with detailed findings, mitigation plans, and any additional 
recommendations.  
Assessment Criteria: Ability to use vulnerability assessment tools 
effectively. Accuracy in identifying critical vulnerabilities. Quality 
of mitigation plans and proposed solutions. Clarity and 
effectiveness in the presentation. Thoroughness and 
organization of the final report.
